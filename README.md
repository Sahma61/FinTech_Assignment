The project contains the following components:

1. **backend.py** (Python3) - module that contains:
   - Utility to download SEC 10-K filings
   - Utility to fetch data from LLM Model
   - Utility to fetch info from LLM Model
   - Utility to parse text from HTML page
   - Utility to get Pandas DataFrame from list of string info

2. **flask_server.py** (Python3, Flask)  - Locally-hosted Flask Server that initializes the LLM Model and utilizes the backend utilities to fetch data and info from LLM APIs.

3. **app.py** (Python3, Dash) - Dashboard to show SEC 10-K info and data

Steps to run the Project:
1. Run the **Flask Server** - `python flask_server.py`
2. Run the **Dash  App** - `python app.py`
3. Goto [Web Dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)

## **Note**:
The main reason for choosing Python is its extensive library support and the ease of coding up new things. Additionally, Python has been my go-to language since college days, and I have primarily worked in Python in a professional setting for 2 years. Therefore, it seems natural to me.

Dashboard creation/frontend development is usually not my primary experience, but I have tried to use Dash as it's Python-supported and I needed very little to get started.

For Server Creation, Flask is the best option available for Python environment. And, I have previously worked with it in a Production environment.
